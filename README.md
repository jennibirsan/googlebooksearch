## About
This Google Book search utilizes the Google Books API and places them on this webpage. Once you retrieve the list, you can either "View Book" or "Save Book". If you View Book, it will redirect you to that book's landing page on Google Play. Or if you click Save Book, then you can save these books and access them later in the "Saved Books" landing page. It will also add them to your mongoDB. In the Saved Books landing page, you can view the book in the Google Books website or you can delete it from your saved queue.
